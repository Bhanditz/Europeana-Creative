# Europeana Creative

The project sets out to demonstrate that Europeana, the online portal providing access to more than 26 million digitised cultural heritage objects from Europe's libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections, can facilitate the creative re-use of digital cultural heritage content and associated metadata. Partners will develop a number of pilot applications focused on design, tourism, education and social networks. Building on these pilots, a series of open innovation challenges will be launched with entrepreneurs from the creative industries to identify, incubate and spin-off more viable projects into the commercial sector.
