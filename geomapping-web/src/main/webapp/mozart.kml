			Directly behind St. Stephen’s Cathedral is this three-story museum where Mozart lived from 1784 to 1787. When we visit, we stand in the room where Mozart and Beethoven met, and where Haydn told Mozart’s father “your son is the greatest composer I know in person or by name”.  
			<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mozarthaus_Vienna" target="_new">Mozarthaus Vienna</a>  is a great museum to visit.

		Mozart monument in front of the cafe Mozart has been moved to <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burggarten_%28Wien%29" target="_new">Burggarten</a> in 1953.
		This is one of the famous images of Vienna. It was erected in 1898 and moved to its current location in 1953. Vienna’s love of Mozart is seen in the monument’s prominent location just next to the Hofburg complex.

			Mozart was buried in an anonymous grave shortly after his death on December 5, 1791 in <a target="_new" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankt_Marxer_Friedhof#Das_Mozartgrab">St. Marx Cemetery</a>.
			His widow visited the cemetery in 1855 for the first time, when the location of the grave was identified as good as possible. 
			Later, in 1859 an monument was placed on the grave, which was later on moved to Central Cemetery.  
			The moving monument of a crying angel is a fitting tribute to the composer who died at the young age of 35.
